# Javascript and DOM manipulation

### Background:

This activity involves writing a code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. It also involves allowing the users to filter the table data for specific values. These goals can be achieved by using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js only.

It includes two levels:

## Level 1: Automatic Table loading, and Date Search

* Create a basic HTML web page.
* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
    * Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.
* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.
* Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
    * date/time
    * city
    * state
    * country
    * shape
